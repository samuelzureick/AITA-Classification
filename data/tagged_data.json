We were reading funny Reddit comments to each other and I found an interesting fact on bees and decided to share it. \n\nThis for context: \"Male honey bees are called drones and their only purpose is reproduction. They don\u2019t even have a stinger. When they succeed in mating with a queen, their genitals explode and they die. If they don\u2019t succeed in mating with a queen, they are dragged out of the hive by the worker bees (female) before winter, and die.\"\n\nI told him this pretty excitedly because I thought it was the kind of cool slightly gross fact we love to share. He didn't think so and started getting aggressive over how it's a gendered offensive comment and I should basically know better. I tried to defuse it but it didn't work.\n\nHe started talking about how it was unfair that men were getting attacked just for being male and that people are using animals to make extrapolations on men. I tried to explain it was a cool bee fact but he blamed me for reading gendered comments from shitty subreddits. He started going on about job inequalities and how women get more benefits and he stalked out of the kitchen.\n\nLater when he walked by me he said \"Hi, Slut\" really angrily.\nNow I'm sitting here 7 hours later and he's still furious at me.\n\nI'm pretty sure it was my bad from the start and I should have picked better things to share, but I feel his reaction is a bit unfair as well.

My family growing up always went on family vacations together. To me the idea of spending a two week long vacation separate from each other just seems a bit weird.

I don't usually tell anyone that I'm into women unless they explicitly ask.\n\nMy boyfriend saw it and got really mad. Like, fucking furious. He says that I'm in an relationship so there's no need to put my sexual preferences in my bio because I'm not \"open for shop\". He said that now girls are going to be attracted to me and guys are going to fetishsize me. He basically thinks this is a precursor to cheating.\n\nHe says that my bio and my \"provocative\" photos are giving people ideas.\n\nI explained to him that I'm trying to show support to my niece but my boyfriend says that I don't have a choice. I either take it out or I'm leaving.\n\nAm I an asshole? I understand where he's coming from. All his friends seem to agree with him but I have *zero* ill intentions. ######","908":"Growing up my mom was big in to charity work (not donating money but giving things to people who they thought needed it), it might sound like a good thing but a lot of the times it was taking something from me (yes most of it was given to me by her but they didn\u2019t limit it to things purchased by her) giving it to someone who they felt needed it more eg taking my spare phone and donating it to one of the workers around my block because they needed it more.\n\nThis has eaten at me over the years and has completely put me off any kind of human philanthropy, I do a lot of work for animals ( I prefer being around animals than humans if that helps)\n\nRecently There\u2019s been pressure for me to be more generous and do more charity work for people that need it (given that there\u2019s a pandemic) and I\u2019m getting shit for choosing to donate to animals instead \n\nAnd ofc if someone who I know and like is having a hard time I do reach out and try to help wherever possible but am not into giving away shit to random people \n\nSo AITA? ######","929":"Throwaway as I don't want to use my main.\n\nWhen lockdown happened in March my mum asked could she stay with my wife and I while lockdown was happening as she was worried she'd get lonely during it. I asked my wife and we agreed as we both get on with her well and often go on holidays together abroad.\n\nI thought things were going fine but today my mum seems to have snapped. I said to my wife 'love you beautiful' and my mum snapped shouting 'how many times a day do you two have to say you fucking love eachother?' we were both taken back and I told her we probably say it 4 or 5 times a day which to us doesn't seem excessive. This annoyed her further and she said 'youve been together 8 years now. That's well past the honeymoon stage of saying I love you constantly'. My wife started crying at this point so I told my mum she had to apologise if she wanted any chance of staying under our roof or she could go home. She said a very sarcastic sorry and stormed off to her room and won't come out. My wife has asked me not to force her to leave because she doesn't want to create any drama and my mums probably just stressed from being in lockdown so long. \n\nI'm now starting to wonder if I'm an asshole for telling my wife I love her infront of my mum. We don't say it constantly around her, maybe twice a day and the other times are when it's just the two of us. ######","997":"So I basically (17f) had been diagnosed with ADHD a year ago .

I wanted to proceed to book other sessions to see what I can do to help minimise the issue . It started affecting my studies . My mother didn't believe me and told me I was doing this for attention and not to tell anyone about it . ( In our culture mental health is a taboo topic ) I wasn't happy about it I tried to retaliate anything . But it was no use and my father whose a doctor tried to convince her but nothing .  \nSo suddenly today she heard one of her friends had a daughter with ADHD so she told her about and proceeded to tell all her colleagues like it's something to flaunt I guess . And now she believes I have it . \nI was pretty furious since she had forbidden to go my therapist for almost half a year and continued to call me an attention seeker whenever I braught it up . \nThe fight was bad I was screaming at the top of my lungs in the end and shut myself in my room .

(There were a few more incidents, like when I caught them knocking over my fire pit, but nothing big. The kids were usually nice.)\n\nI told my kids they can't play with the neighbors anymore, and my son is sad but understands but my daughter is furious, because she says the 4yo neighbor is her best friend.

It was just across the street, not a huge deal. They were fine \n\n\nThat said, a rule was broken. So I punished them. No going around the block for the rest of the day(and this was at 9:30am so it really was a whole day).\n\n\nMy husband thought it was harsh because it was a harmless move. No one got hurt or kidnapped, they saw something cool\/educational, and they only went just across the street for a few minutes.\n\n\nI thought it was more of a principal rule and figured if we allow this, they\u2019ll push their luck for more later and end up lost or hurt.\n\n\nI\u2019m open to discussing a bigger biking circle than just around the block but that needs to be discussed, not something they can decide for themselves, especially when their 4 year old sibling is with them. ######","1127":"I ordered some food from UberEats and receive a message stating that it should be delivered in no later than 30 minutes.

She accuses us of reading things into the texts he sent to try and ruin the relationship and that this will \"never be fixed because you jumped to conclusions about what he was saying\".

Her brother knows this but constantly tells everyone who comes into the house they're getting rid of her because she's a terrible cat. I try to change the subject or leave but he keeps saying it. Well now he's topped it by saying he hopes someone adopts her when she's in the 'pound' but if no one does and she gets euthanized he'll understand. I've tried to shrug this off and say it's his disorder, but the way he treats Fluff and the way he's acting was hurting me I snapped and told him Fluff is leaving for his new roommate, not because she's 'bad', she'll likely find a way better loving home with an owner who actually deserves her.

We are currently working on our guest list and I really don\u2019t want to invite her. I feel like she would be there for all the wrong reasons. I also don\u2019t want my mom to be uncomfortable, even though she would never tell me if she was. My mom is a saint. I do feel bad because that is my dad\u2019s sister and I know it would mean a lot to him if she was there.\n\nAITA for not wanting my aunt at my wedding? ######","2758":"My fianc\u00e9 and I have been together for 5 years. She has always told me that she hates her name. I\u2019m going to use a fake name here for obvious reasons, but it\u2019s similar, for example it\u2019s something like her name is Kathryn and she goes by Katie. She chooses to go by \u201cKatie\u201d (or the real shorter version of her name) because to her it is the best version of her name. She detests her full name purely because it sounds \u201cgrandmaish\u201d to her and she wishes it was something else.\n\nKatie has always been a dancer and a couple of years ago, she got into burlesque dancing. She started entering amateur competitions and goes to conventions as well. I support her doing so, it\u2019s a fun hobby for her. A part of her being in the burlesque community is having a stage name. She chose to go by \u201cGypsy\u201d during her shows and yes, that is really what she chose, not making it up. For the first year she just used it for shows but then slowly started using it in her every day life. She changed her Instagram name to reflect that and then changed her name badge at work, followed by her FB profile. \n\nAround NYE\u2019s she asked everyone in her life, me included, to start calling her Gypsy. I said no.  I think it\u2019s a fine nickname but it\u2019s not her name. I further said that expecting everyone to call her something else was ridiculous when we all knew her as \u201cKatie\u201d and she needed to leave her Burlesque persona on the stage. I also pointed out in some communities her name was considered a slur and she needed to rethink it. She got upset and said it was her name, she could change it. \n\nMost of our friends call her \u201cGypsy\u201d now, but her family and I still call her Katie. Recently, she posted a long rant on Instagram about her name change not being respected. Keep in mind, she didn\u2019t legally change her name. She got some backlash from her community, telling her to keep her persona on stage, some said I and her family were assholes. Am I being an ass here? ######","2817":"My parents pay for my undergraduate degree and also pay for my brother\u2019s masters.

Either way, one of us would have to pause their studies so the other can continue. He wants to continue even though he\u2019s not close to finishing his studies yet and he already has his undergraduate degree. I want to continue because I\u2019m so close to finishing, i just have one more period to go and I\u2019m done.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?? ######","2936":"I am a 20yr zoology and environmental science student from the US.

I yelled at him in surprise and was super pissed that the bee was dead for no reason. He claimed he did it bc he\u2019s scared of bees. \nI was mad at him the rest of the day, basically just being curt and not very talkative with him. My parents think I am just being sensitive, which I probably am, but I think its wrong to hurt an endangered species just because you are scared of them. It\u2019s a bee, please just walk away.

She then says that is super creepy, that it is worrying that I am still into college-aged women. I was like she is over 18 nothing weird about it and that she is just jealous. She said that I only find her attractive because I am intimidated by women my age and older.\n\nI was like if anything you are the one that was intimidated by younger women. She was like nothing to be scared of, real men go for women their age. I was like yup, okay, that's why you get lip fillers and botox to try to look younger. \n\nMy dad just starts laughing his ass off. And my mom and sister both get super angry at me.

This just started after her 17 year old cousin did it. I've always considered myself a supportive mom and let my kids do whatever they want (within reason of course) \n\nShe had extremely long, blonde, gorgeous hair just like I do. She was fully aware that I was going to support her decision, school was cancelled for the rest of the year and she won't go back to school until August (possibly September) so her hair will have time to grow out.\n\nSo last night, I got out my husband's clippers and shaved her head for her. She smiled the whole time and loved the end result.  \n\nThe next day, I took a photo to send to my mom and only my mom. My mom decided to forward it to a bunch of other family members, who got back to me. 90% of them agree that I'm the asshole for not saying no to her and setting limits for her, and also told me that I'm setting her up for bullying.\n\nHere's the thing - it's literally her hair will grow back. She knows. I asked her if she regretted it and she is extremely happy that she did it. As for bullying, she knows how to stand up for herself and that hair doesn't define her beauty.\n\nI personally don't think I'm TA but I want to know everyone else's views on this. ######","3011":"My daughter and I are on the same medication, same dosage. We take it at the same time every day (early afternoon) because of side effects. She is too young to carry it with her or remember to take it herself, so I carry it.\n\nI don't particularly enjoy carrying a purse, so on days when I know we will be out when it's time to take meds, I will just bring one of the bottles (because I can fit one in my pocket comfortably), either mine or hers. I then add an extra pill from the other bottle when I get home to keep them even. \n\nHowever, when I went to drop off my daughter at her dad's house, I accidentally brought the pill bottle with my name on it instead of hers. I told him that he could just use mine, no big deal, and that we both take pills from either bottle because again, it's the exact same medication and the exact same dosage. I would understand if he wasn't comfortable using my pill bottle because it isn't technically her prescription, but he lost it at me and accused me of stealing her meds and shuffling pills around to hide it. He thinks there is more of a risk for me to give her the wrong dose because I'm not keeping the pills separate. I think he's being ridiculous. One pill is one pill coming from either prescription bottle. I'm not going to somehow give her extra pills.

The rest of the text was her telling me that I need to keep my bras out of the laundry room because apparently, when she had her boyfriend over, he went in there and saw my bras hanging up to dry on the drying rack, and was so shocked?intrigued?whatever that he checked the fucking tags (I have no idea if this is normal male behavior, but it creeped me out to read) to see the size, and then \u201cwouldn\u2019t stop talking about it.\u201d \n\nI responded with, basically, \u201cthen tell your boyfriend to keep his hands off my shit and shut up.\u201d Flatmate did not consider this an adequate response, and told me that I should keep my \u201cpornstar bras\u201d in my room because it\u2019s apparently inappropriate to dry them in the laundry room. At this point I was quite annoyed; I don\u2019t wear \u201cpornstar bras,\u201d I just have very large breasts, and they\u2019re a literal constant source of annoyance and back pain. The bras in question were totally normal, but apparently them being a UK 34H makes them inappropriate. I told her that I\u2019m not going to try to dry my bras in my room since it\u2019s tiny and we have a perfectly good drying rack in the laundry room, which is for laundry, and that both she and her boyfriend needed to get over it and grow up.

We come up to help them take care of the house and yard, and we are both pretty handy so we help fix things that inevitably break around the place. We typically spend 3-4 days of the week here during the spring\/summer months, and 1-2x\/month during the fall\/winter (we can both work remotely so no issues there).

This afternoon, we got a call from my MIL telling us to move our things up to the loft (which has 2 twin beds and is above\/open to the living room) so my SIL can stay in the bedroom. I don't think this is fair given that we come up more often, do more work, are married, and were already here this weekend. There is also not a bathroom to use that doesn't involve us walking into in-laws bedrooms.

She also paid off the life insurance on the house my dad and Alison had bought, because Alison asked her too. Also, despite my mum paying for the entire funeral cost, Alison planned the entire thing alone, and went against his wishes, we now have no headstone or grave as a result and that kills me every day. My entire family despises Alison, she stressed my dad out a lot and the doctors believed stress contributed to the heart attack which killed him. \n\nYesterday I was in the local supermarket and saw her, with her daughters.

The teachers then decided that it wasn't an issue and this incident went as if it never happened. \n\n\nI was livid. The fact that my child fell down a flight of stairs, which could normally end up badly, was hidden from me just because she was miraculously unhurt? I don't know, this sounds wrong in so many ways. I should have the right to know if anything happened to my child in school out of the ordinary.\n\n\nI posted this incident on social media while demanding an explanation from the school. I was told by the school  that they hope that I could put it down because I am giving my daugher unnecessary attention. At the end of the day she was not hurt and I should just move on like she did. True to that, my daughter seems to be over it and doesn't seems to care. Should I drop this?

I said I'd consider fostering or maybe adopting, but it's unlikely. I also said I don't want kids because I want to be someone's favourite person, and a child would end up being my partner's favourite. \n\nMy sister said that's a shitty reason to not want kids, and that I'm an asshole for even saying that.

His school has a heavily discounted drivers ed program that they run twice a year, once in the fall and once in the spring. My son's father and I agreed that he would take that program because it was designed around school hours and much less expensive. My son qualified to take the program in the spring, and could get his license at the beginning of June. If he didn't take it in the spring, he couldn't get his license until January.\n\nMy son lives with me most of the time and goes to his dad's every other weekend.

He did not consult me on this.\n\nI was very upset when he told me this and asked him to change the punishment. He refused because he felt he would undermine his own authority. I pointed out that this punishment made my life harder, because that was 6 more months that I would have to drive him to school, extracurriculars, friends' houses etc. He still refused to change the punishment, so I told him that I was going to pay for drivers ed on my own. I was very frustrated that he wouldn't work with me, especially because I have made sure that my punishments in the past haven't affected his relationships with his father. For example, I don't take away his cell phone because he texts with his dad during the week.\n\nWhen my son came back to my house, I told him that he could still take driver's ed but he would still not be able to have friends over for a week as his new punishment. He has since been in contact with his father much less and his father blames me for undermining him and letting him take drivers ed anyway.

Today (well, yesterday 33 minutes ago) was my 29th birthday and my girlfriend of 4 years raised a point I honestly hadn't considered until now. When I was 3, my mother and father divorced and split custody until I was 18, with them both being remarried when I was in 3rd and 5th grade respectively. My dad has since passed on (2010) at 58 and my stepmother remarried again, so my mother and stepfather are the extent of my family (no siblings, distant extended family, all grandparents deceased). Anyhow, when I was 8, my mother and stepfather got remarried and I treated the whole process as normal until I actually started developing a little emotional intelligence and had someone who I trust ask how I felt about it. As a kid and young adult, I was very much a people pleaser and more or less assumed it was just something it was my responsibility to accept. As an adult of 29, it was a little irritating to see my stepfather post endless pictures of his anniversary celebration and I haven't heard from him yet. I know I shouldn't care but it's particularly irritating because I make a point of calling him on his birthday AND father's day every year, in contrast to several years where his own kids from his previous marriage (3, early 40s to late 30s) forgot.

Salvi is my boyfriend, mom is my mother, dad is my father, Marie is my sister, I\u2019m 20, as is Salvi.\n\nSo, as a child, my mother was hyper-conscious about my weight. It translates into me being on diets from the age of seven. As an early teenager, I struggled with an eating disorder, and the road to recovery has been a messy one.

Note: my father wasn\u2019t really okay with the diets, but he never opposes my mother, which has causes tensions.\n\nOkay, so my parents house is being sold, so they asked if they can stay at mine until they find a new place, and I agreed. That was two months ago.\n\nLike three days in, my mother started commenting about how I had gained weight, and that I should eat less, and it\u2019s been making me feel worse, and worse, and I\u2019m starting to enter old habits. I\u2019ve tried to tell my mother that I am an adult, I can know what to eat, to no avail.\n\nLast night, after a certain remark, I snapped, and told my mother that she could either stop fucking remarking, or she could leave (and by extension my dad), and it escalated into a huge argument, and they both left to my sister\u2019s.\n\nMy sister called me up to tell me that I was an asshole for how I handled the situation, and that I should apologise, and that my mother just shows love in weird ways.\n\nSalvi will support me either way, but he prefers they don\u2019t come here.\n\nSo Reddit !!

Our mother died years ago, so I am the only one left in our family that's closest to him.

Some people were wondering why my brother wasn't there and I explained the situation that he is on his honeymoon. A few people thought it was the right thing to let him enjoy it, others thought I should have told my brother, so I guess that is where the divide began.\n\nA few days after the funeral my brother came out and I quickly texted him that our father died.

At this point I'd completely lost my train of thought with the email, so when she asked me why someone would get autodeposit, I snapped at her and said \"what are you trying to do?\" She said she was sending [redacted] some money we owed her for some kid-related activity.\n\nI put down my laptop and walked over to her quickly and said something along the lines of \"let me see that\", looked at her screen was like \"if this is the email address you have for [redatcted], then it's probably going to transfer money to [redacted], but if you don't think the name is right, then don't do it.\" I was very curt with her and stomped back over to my laptop and tried to get back to my email.\n\nNow I feel like an asshole because she told me I hurt her feelings and went off to bed.

My wife and I are divorced, and my wife remarried a very wealthy man and I believe they are spoiling our daughter (12 F) and attempting to turn her against me (42 M). I work in a restaurant and am a single father, so I can't afford ridiculous luxuries such as new iPhones and air pods for my daughter every Christmas that she seems to receive over there. I finally had enough when she came to my house with an iPad that is worth half of my rent, and I told her that if she is going to walk around acting wealthy she should at least be able to help with the rent and other necessities. I made her get a job reffing local soccer games which she does all weekend (half of her earnings go to bills, the other half go in savings) and I restricted her from using the fancy tech she gets at her mother's. I feel that this will better prepare her for real life and have her be less spoiled, but her mother got wind of it and said that it was not necessary and is taking away the freedom from her childhood.

Now he is inelgilbe for the stimulus check and demands that I pay him 1200 dollars.  He was let go from his job, and has virtually no money for rent and other expenses.

Normally it's small so no one says anything.\n\nBefore the pandemic we went to my nieces birthday, she's 1e, I brought her a nice gift, but knowing she's getting some big ticket items from her mother and father I bought RJ a large Barbie house so that she could feel special as well when her cousin is opening up  a tablet and other toys. \n\nWhen we got their I placed a gift bag on the table- earrings and dress up necklace for the birthday girl, but kept the bigger one put aside.

However, she feels that since she is my wife it's different and I am being an asshole by ignoring her calls. She says that since she doesn't call often unless it's important and we have kids I should pick up unless I'm truly busy. Her argument is that it could be an emergency and I'd never know (she could always text or call my workplace so I don't think this is a good argument). \n\nI don't agree at all with her view that I should pick up unless I'm busy. For one thing I believe a lunch break counts as being busy. I don't like to be bothered while I am eating, and I don't think there's anything unreasonable about wanting to relax on break. I also disagree with her claim that she only calls me when it's important. There have been plenty of times where she's called me about trivial things or to shoot the breeze. That's fine but I don't always want to talk. Sometimes I just want to focus on whatever I'm doing or not doing. She may not value relaxation time, but that doesn't mean it's fair to discount it. \n\nI could maybe see her point if I never responded, but eventually I do call her back or respond.

She suggested we post here to see who is right and I thought, hell why not. Could be an interesting little experiment.\n\nHere is my side:\n\nWhen out and about, I am very honest when people ask me how I am doing or how my day is going. Whether it is the cashier at the grocery store, the bank teller, a neighbour, my kids' friends or boyfriends, their parents, etc., when they ask me how I'm doing or how my day is going I give them an honest answer. Sure, this sometimes means that the answer is negative, but I feel like if people don't want an actual answer, why would they ask in the first place? I pride myself on my honesty and on telling it like I see it, so I see no reason to be dishonest when asked a direct question. \n\nMy daughter's side:\n\nMy mom doesn't get that people ask this out of politeness and not because they actually want to know how she is. The grocery store cashier making minimum wage is just trying to do their job and doesn't actually give a shit how every customer is doing that day. It's a formality, and the thing to do is say \"Good, you?\" and move on. Also, she goes into way too much detail about what exactly is bothering her, has started crying at cash registers, to my boyfriend and friends, to anyone really when she is having a bad day or is stressed out, and doesn't see that this makes people uncomfortable who were basically just saying hello and hoping to move on with their day. It's really embarrassing. Also 'priding herself on honesty' is just a fancy way of saying that you don't care about being mean to people, imo....\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA? Does my daughter have a point, or am I right in saying that if you're going to ask someone how they are, you should actually mean it and should want and expect an honest answer?

But a few days ago, they informed me that i was being let go, just from my current position. They offered me a lower paying position though. That's not what made me quit, i was gonna try to be a company woman. The person they wanted to bring in to replace me, they literally wanted me to be the one to train them. They want me to train my REPLACEMENT. They wouldn't even tell me why i was being bumped. That was a huge insult.\n\nI was furious and just quit then and there. I told them they could find another stooge. When my son got home, i asked him politely to quit. But he told me no, not because of the money, but there's this girl he likes there. It led into a bit of an argument, i asked him to do it for me. I basically begged him to do so, to call the boss and tell him he's quitting. I told him i didn't want to work for a company that would do this to his mom. But he just asked \"What am i supposed to do now? Nobody's hiring\" and how he's upset he won't get to see her again.\n\nWas it wrong of me to use my son to help make a statement? ######","2359":"My parents invited My brother (22M) for dinner as we hadn't seen him in a while. I (20F) was weirded out because he brought his roommate to a family dinner. Halfway through the night he drops the 'boyfriend' bomb. See my best friend had asked my brother on a date (just the earlier that day!) and he said yes. She's has terrible insecurity, confidence, body image issue and has bad anxiety so that was a big thing for her. Now I was finding out he was gay and had a boyfriend. I insulted him and called him names (not homophobic slurs) because I couldn't believe he would do that to someone I consider a sister.\n\nHe said he felt really put on the spot when she asked and people where around and he didn't want to embarrass her. He said he was going to explain to her tomorrow that he was gay, which is why he was coming out to us now. He'd already told his boyfriend and I made him call her up right then and let her down.\n\nMy mom said I was too harsh on him after just coming out and in front of his boyfriend. ######","2394":" \n\nSo I have a habit of calling out to people on bike\/walking paths \"passing left\" and\/or \"plingeling\" (the sound of a bike bell) when coming up from behind before passing whilst exercising, running or biking. This can be used together with a real bike bell but I've found that calling out is more noticeable. Here I have to admit that I when passing people that wear headphones and that take up the majority of the path without moving, since they don't hear me, can get an extra call just when passing just to scare them and make them aware that they need to share the path. I know this is somewhat of a bitch move but I'm just so fed up with people taking up unnecessary space just because they're selfish or inconsiderate.\n\nThis time I was moving up on a teenager from behind getting ready to pass him. He was biking in the middle of the bike lane, leaving precious little space on either side. I was going for a left side pass since we have right hand traffic here. He was wearing headphones and not holding on to the handlebars of his bike. I called out. No response. So when passing, quite close due to the space issue, I called out again and spooked him. This resulted in him twitching, our handlebars locking and him falling of his bike into the road. No cars came just then luckily so no real harm done. The discussion after went something like this:\n\n\\-\"Are you ok?\"\n\n\\-\"Yeah...\"\n\n\\-\"You shouldn't wear headphones if it means you can't hear the traffic when biking.\"\n\n\\-\"Why'd you scare me so I fell?\"\n\n\\-\" I tried calling out before but you didn't hear me.\"\n\n\\-\"But I couldn't hear you because I was wearing headphones!\"\n\n\\-\"Exactly...\"\n\nSo AITA for scaring people when passing because they're wearing headphones? ######"},"completion":{"66":" Your parents have every right to choose a guardian that will live in their house if that's what they want.

I was both her emotional lightning rod and her emotional support animal\u2014my job was to absorb her anger when she was pissy and give her validation and attention when she was in the mood to whine and cry and feel bad.

They said they did but it could've been laced which is dangerous, or they could've done other drugs in combination with it and not told you, etc. The friend could have undisclosed medical problems, like epilepsy, that could make it dangerous, etc. So even though a true pure acid trip isn't generally dangerous (physically) in a controlled setting, you had no way of knowing if there was actually danger or not, so calling the police or an ambulance is the safe (and correct) choice.

The fact that you still tried to help them out says a lot about how nice of a person you are. If your mother won't shut her mouth about your weight then I would seriously consider removing her permanently from my life if I were you. What she has done is so damaging, I know that from personal experience. And seriously, your mom shows love in weird ways?? I can't stand abuse apologists. If you were to tell your mother that she was too fat, looked old and wrinkly, would that be seen as you showing her love? No, I don't think so.

If you gave a shit about doing the right thing, you'd have shared the wealth that she would have been entitled to if your parents weren't awful. You also chose your bigoted family over her up until now by going to events she was banned from and not standing up for her.

But at the same time, there's no guarantee that he'll find a well-paying job if he graduates with a business or engineering degree. And honestly? It's better for him to go after a degree he enjoys and come out with student debt, than to feel forced into studying something he hates so that he can come out with a LITTLE less debt. You're acting like $5k is make-it-or-break it money -- but even two years at a public 4-year university is going to cost $20k or more. Your brother is likely going to graduate with student loans with or without your money, so sending him articles about the \"pressures of paying back student loans\" really doesn't mean much.

I remember being a teenager that just wanted to enjoy life and have the means of doing it, but it's bigger than your mom not getting you what you asked for. The cat becomes a presence in her home, and she has to smell the litterbox, engage with your cat, potentially deal with veterinarian things in the future, and so on. The dirtbike could be a safety thing, and she also has to transport you wherever you want to ride your dirtbike, store it, and so on. You're asking for things that change your mom's life, too. Parents' rules don't always make sense to a teen, and it feels stifling to have any rules when you're getting ready to be an adult.

How can she be so oblivious that I\u2019m doing the exact thing she does to make her understand how annoying it is? Instead she\u2019s acting like it doesn\u2019t matter to her and honestly it\u2019s just pissing me off further.

I can assure you that if a hiring manager saw the name Dragon on a resume they\u2019d throw it out. Kids are also ruthless they\u2019ll tear those names apart and make fun of them and you for choosing such dumb names. In the end your kids will resent you.

You found out because you butt into her family life before she was willing to share that, and you judged her for the fact that her family is less well off than yours. Maybe if you love her, don\u2019t be shallow? I mean, it sucks that she feels the need to perform for her peers to such a level, but you\u2019re not great from the perspective of someone who is meant to value who she is.

Yes, yes, I know, yoghurt, but from experience with people that averse to spice, that often doesn't make a difference. Make a small side batch of mild curry, make something differe or don't offer in the first place ","1972":" . He literally sat you down and begged you to get a job and you were... offended? Jesus Christ. ","1987":" . In a situation like this, you should have gone ahead and shared or asked what he wanted and paid for it in exchange for him paying for your ticket. It was extremely socially awkward of you not to and I see why it keeps you up at nights. So glad that burrito was worth losing a friend over. ","2038":" , it's not cool to make a drama and feel entitled to organizing the restaurant's staff and the way they work. ","2114":" you LOANED a child a doll? Do you really think a 5-year-old understands the concept of a loan? ","2212":" for trolling ","2213":" for trolling ","2227":" for telling him he is idiotic. He obviously doesn\u2019t have a preference for one city over the other. The other things you list are obviously important to you, that doesn\u2019t mean he has to prioritise the same things. Dress is a good indication of the work culture so maybe that is important to him. ","2228":" for taking your daughters money. A better solution would have been to say well it's your money, so you can buy a laptop and you are a very sweet girl for wanting to help your brother. But if you do, as his parents we will have to say that he still won't be allowed to use it until he can show us he is responsible and works hard to bring up his grades. ","2284":" big time >My husband was humiliated and sometimes he sighs and says that he doesn\u2019t know if this will work out. Your husband is also manipulating you. \u2b06\ufe0f ","2310":" and the piercer you went to was irresponsible for agreeing to give *four* piercings to a minor who has never had a single piercing before. Especially a piercing that requires more stringent care like a navel piercing. Whatever people in the comments might tell you, yes people still have hang ups around facial piercings in 2020, and yes they may impact on your daughter\u2019s ability to find work. I doubt she\u2019ll find herself unemployable, but it only takes running into one stuck-up boomer recruiter to get turned down for a job you were otherwise qualified for. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily a reason not to get piercings, but your daughter is 15 and cannot make informed choices regarding her future professional life because she simply doesn\u2019t have the lived experience yet. Most piercing shops in my area won\u2019t do any piercings besides basic lobe piercings on anyone under 18. I\u2019ve had a ton of piercings in my time and know they\u2019re a pain to care for when they\u2019re healing, and can take a long time to stop feeling tender. Caring for four piercings at once sounds like a pain in the ass. The best you can do now is help make sure your daughter is looking after them properly and make sure she doesn\u2019t rush the process. No changing the jewellery until your piercer says it\u2019s okay to do so (even if, again, I\u2019m loath to trust the judgement of any piercer who would perform four piercings on a minor in a single session). ","2347":" This is your sons income and you should be happy that they\u2019re treating him well. Period. As for him liking a girl at work, that\u2019s neither here nor there, but if she\u2019s interested in him then good for them. It\u2019s very selfish of you to expect your son give up his income and job experience because you chose to quit. You were justified in quitting, and that\u2019s fine. But you need to understand that that move was about you, and you only. Don\u2019t involve your kid. ","2359":" Coming out is such a raw and vulnerable mome and you chose that moment to scream at him and call him names? You could have just pulled him aside later and said \"hey, I'm disappointed with how you handled the situation with my best friend\" and you could have talked about it. ","2394":" - whether he was unsafe or not, you caused the accident.
